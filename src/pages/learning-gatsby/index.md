Gatsby is a framework that uses React and GraphQL to build static web pages.

## Why Gatsby?

We have all the benefits of React and GraphQL.

Besides that, Gatsby uses configuration files to build only static files with extreme fast page loads, service workers to offline support, optimized image loading, asset optimization, and data prefetching.

Now we have HTML, CSS, and JavaScript covered by React, which is the best option at the moment for a frontend framework. And to pull data, we can use GraphQL to retrieve data from Markdowns, JSON, CMS, APIs, and any other data source.

Gatsby comes with an extensive collection of plugins to add functionality to your website. You can probably switch from WordPress to Gatsby if you need performance.

Initially, I have built my blog into WordPress environment, so I decided to move to Gatsby for learning purposes, and I was surprised by its performance. I won't go back to WordPress. Now I can manage my posts by writing Markdown files and committing them to my GitHub.

Another point is there will be no database layer in my blog and no server at all!

I will try to build my next landing pages using Gatsby.
