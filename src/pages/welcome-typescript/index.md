Typescript is a superset of Javascript library that allows you to get errors in compilation time, instead of some unpredictable behavior caused at runtime by a loosely typed language like Javascript.

## Why Typescript?

I've recently finished a Web Application with my team written with Typescript, and to be honest, in the beginning, I did not think that could be a good idea. 

But looking back now, it gave us the confidence to avoid some common mistakes in JavaScript and leveraged our knowledge in JavaScript by going under the hoods and understanding how many things work like Syntethic Events and being able to write our own custom typed library.

The configuration was quite messy first, but writing custom interfaces and working with Enums made our life easier to match the back-end server's model typing. 

In the long run, it will make your app much easier to understand.
If you are working with React, you'll have more information about the components, extra data about props and state, and proper support from Visual Studio Code extensions. 

I recommend you to try it out!
